# yfinance_utils
Just adding some utilities to the yfinance library to make it easier to do technical analysis on any stock. maybe run models and do ad-hoc scenarios.

TODO: I uploaded this manually, the paths are all wrong, need to update as soon as I can connect from my computer.
ONLY USE IF YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING. OTHERWISE JUST WAIT A LITTLE UNTIL I GET EVERYTHING IN ITS PLACE
